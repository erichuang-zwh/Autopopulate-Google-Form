Automate cumbersome form population

Since March 2019, the company I am working for asked everyone to report where they are working at as well as whether or not you observe symptons of COVID19. While the intention is to make sure all employees are COVID free, yet filling the same fields again and again is cumbersome, for example, picking the current date from the droplist, keying your name & employee ID, indicating where you are working at. 

Therefore, I try to use Python to automate the form population process when you are free with COVID and work from home (in case you observe symptons of COVID 19, then you are really populate the form manually :(

Turns out the script does save me 1 min a day to use on checking email. Every small win counts :)
